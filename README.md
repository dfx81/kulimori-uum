Some post-mortem:

- Game Code can be optimized further. Some checks can be removed
without severe impact on the game.
- Timing of the input block and card hiding are a bit off. This
can be noticed when revealing the cards too fast.
- Some of the images appear stretched or squashed.
- The Database is public. Heavy security flaw if no Auth used.

(NOTE: This website is no longer being maintained.
It will still be live but expect no further updates except
when it's necessary.)
